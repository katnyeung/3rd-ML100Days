In supervised learning, you having a clear outcome already. The classification could be accurate and the learning speed is fast.
However, there could be tons of preparation before you could start training, and the data preparation may require humans labor force.

On the other hand, when your data does not contains a precise label. unsupervised learning is a good fit for this situation. 
the data could be easily separated into different parts with different approaches.
However, the classification is not precise and accurately compare to supervised learning, and the classification is just about grouping the data.
The outcome could also be varied and may not contains the desired label with your expectation.

In conclusion, supervised learning should be used when you have a clear label and well-prepared data. 
And unsupervised learning should be used when you want a peek at the relation of unorganized data.
In real situations, they have always used together vice versa. unsupervised learning looks for the feature in the data and supervised learning trains the labeled data.
